# Encoding-Categorical-Data

Categorical data is non-numerical data that represents categories or groups. Examples of categorical data include gender (male/female), color (red/green/blue), and occupation (doctor/lawyer/teacher). In order to use categorical data in machine learning algorithms, it needs to be encoded into numerical data.
